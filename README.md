## Why this site was maded?
```
One day after graduating, I wondered what can I do. I studied many basic computer theories such as OS and DB.
But I didn't know what can I do with them. I decided to make something.
I didn't know almost technologies like React, Spring and Gradle.
I learned each technologies and reffered to official sites.
After following official guide, I applied that to this project.
I hope that this project could be best-practice of understanding technologies at these days.
