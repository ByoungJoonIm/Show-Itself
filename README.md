## Why this site was maded?
```
One day after graduating, I noticed that I don't know current technologies such as
spring, react and so on. I studied basic computer theories like OS and DB only.
So I decided to test myself by learning new things.
Almost technologies which used this project is not friendly at this time,
But I hope to would be best practice.
I have refered to offical site for each technology and technique.
